# Exercises

In this repository you will find a selection of different exercises to prepare you for the development of web applications.

To be able to evaluate your own level of knowledge and at the same time have a common thread in your learning, I recommend this [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend).

According to the roadmap it would be best to get an overview of the following topics before you start the exercises:
- How does the internet work
- What is HTTP
- Browsers and how they work
- DNS and how it works
- What is Domain Name
- What is hosting

Have fun! :rocket:
